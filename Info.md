The Top 14 Python Libraries for Cybersecurity

Python is most popular language because its free and straight forward means easy to learn, requires less lines of code. Python’s library is vast. There are many libraires used for cybersecurity like as follows: 

**Network security libraries**
Tools like NMAP and Twisted are broadly used for scanning of network layer and enumeration of ports, different application protocols.

- **Beautiful Soup**
It is used for collecting the scrap data form webpage in form of HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) and XML (Extensible Markup Language). 

- **YARA**
It is used for malware identification and classification.

- **Mechanize**
It is used for interacting with data. It is also used for SQL Injection and XSS (Cross Side Scripting). It can used to catch data of webpage.

- **Pymetasploit3**
In this library you can use Metasploit framework to find different vulnerabilities on different environment or platform like for mobile exploitation, Linux exploitation, Windows exploitation.

Metasploit contain vast number of payloads.

- **Scapy**
It is used for decoding packets, analysing packets, packet processing on any network.

- **Cryptography Library**
Cryptography libraries are used to secure or encrypt any file for process using cryptographic algorithms.

- **Psscan**
It is used to expose terminated process, means which process are already stopped. This helps in finding the previous process from which we can find some information about the attacker. 

- **Pslist**
It uses to show all process and verify which process how started and ended. This can used to find the behaviour of the process.

- **Twisted**
Twisted is network programming framework written in Python, which is developed by Glyph Lefkowitz and it is licensed under MIT license. Released on October 22, 2002. I basically help us to create SMTP, SSH, HTTP servers, etc. with more accuracy and ease. 

- **Pylibnet**
Pylibnet is a python module used for injection of libnet packets. Basically, libnet is an API which is used for creation and injection of network packets. It is also used for construction of network packets at IP layer, Link layer and as the host of supplementary and complementary functionality 

- **RawSocketPy**
Raw Socket is a layer 2 python library which is used for communication using only MAC address. This allows us to make custom Wi-Fi/Ethernet communication system which is made without using IP, TCP or UDP.

Pwntools
Pwntools is a CTF toolkit which is a CTF framework and exploit development library. It is used for fast development of exploit writing with peak ease.

Requests
Request in python will allow you to send HTTP/1.1 requests. It will give us all content, encoding, status as a response object. Response object contains the server’s response to the HTTP request. There are many more useful libraries too, above listed are the famous one.
